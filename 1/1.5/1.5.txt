If the interpreter uses normal order evaluation (subsituting operands before evaluating), execution should work just fine. The second operand is subsituted as the if statement's alternative, then the if statement is evaluated and yields the consequent. With applicative order, it will hang on trying to evaluate (p) repeatedly before evaluating the predicate.

Turns out DrRacket uses applicative order.
